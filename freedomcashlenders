Repayment policies vary by lender: Because Credible is a marketplace rather than a lender, co-signer releases, financial hardship issues, and loan discharges are handled differently based on the lender issuing the loan. 
No special incentives for Credible users: With some loan marketplace platforms, customers may qualify for additional interest rate discounts or cash-back bonuses. But with Credible, there’s no added bonus for using the platform to compare rates. 
International students must have a co-signer: Although some lenders will work with international students who don’t have co-signers, Credible does not. International students must have a co-signer who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident to qualify for a loan through Credible’s platform.
